# Internet Use Policy

Access to telecommunications will enable students and staff to explore thousands of libraries, databases, and bulletin boards while exchanging messages with people throughout the world. The School Committee believes that the benefits to students and staff from access in the form of information resources and opportunities for collaboration exceed the disadvantages. But ultimately, parents and guardians of minors are responsible for setting and conveying the standards their children should follow when using media and information sources. To that end, The Haverhill Public School System supports and respects each family’s right to decide whether or not to grant permission for supervised access.

The School Committee authorizes the Superintendent to prepare appropriate procedures for implementing this policy and for
reviewing and evaluating its effect on instruction and student achievement. Copies of the Internet Policy are available in the Main Office.
